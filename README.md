# PreAuthFlow
*Pre-Authorization + Workflow = PreAuthFlow*

This productivity application was developed to support the current demands associated to my line of work and more effectively filter time-sensitive issues.

## How To Use
1. Enter your choice for calendar date in mm/dd/yyyy format or select from Chrome integrated calendar (usually today's date but it works for any date)
2. Click on the arrow button (âž”) to register your calendar input
3. The application will calculate and list the number of days/dates based on the calendar date
- Weekday accounts for Mondays-Thursdays
- Friday includes more days/dates to account for the weekend
- Holiday includes more days/dates to account for if the holiday falls near a weekend
